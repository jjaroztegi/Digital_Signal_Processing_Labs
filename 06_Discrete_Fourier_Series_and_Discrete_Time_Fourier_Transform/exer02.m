%% Exercise 2 c)

% The ability of the IDTFT to accurately reconstruct the original signal
% depends on various factors, including the sampling frequency, the choice
% of Fourier coefficients, and the inherent characteristics of the signal.
% If the reconstructed signal closely matches the original, it demonstrates
% the effectiveness of the Fourier transform in capturing the essential
% features of the signal. On the other hand, noticeable discrepancies may
% indicate the need for adjustments in sampling rates, windowing
% techniques, or the number of points used in the transformation to enhance
% reconstruction fidelity.
